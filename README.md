# API v1.0
This version of the Nonverse API was created whilst the network architecture was still being designed. It contained endpoints for a number of different services that were planned but were dropped.

Since then Nonverse's main focus will be on creating a quality Minecraft server network and will **NOT** be offerering any other services as of the time of writing **[08-09-2021]**

- Version 1.0 of the Nonverse API is now fully deprecated and all development for it has been ceased as with all repository under the redundancy organization.  
- Any requests to version 1.0 of the Nonverse API will be met with a HTTP error 500
- The newer version of the Nonverse API which can be found [here](https://github.com/nonverse/api), will continue to be deployed on the original host, **api.nonverse.net**

Please note that the current active version of the Nonverse API [v2.x] is also being developed while the network is still being planned and designed. Any repositories under the [active organization](https://github.com/nonverse) are **NOT** final
